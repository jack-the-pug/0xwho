## How can use it?

1. clone the repo;
2. install deps:
```bash
yarn
```
3. build it:
```bash
yarn build
```
3. go to `chrome://extensions/`;
4. enable `Developer mode`;
5. `Load unpacked` and select the `extenstion` folder;

## Why not make the extenstion available through the chrome web store?

It's dangerous to use a chrome ext that can tamper the content of your webpages.

So, read the code and build it yourself. And also don't forget to drink plenty of water today and always get enough sleep.
